**Stock Price Prediction Results:**

1. **Model Summary:**
   - LSTM model trained for 5 epochs on stock closing prices.
   - Used 60-day lookback window to predict next day's price.

2. **Plot:**
   - Output graph shows the actual vs predicted prices.
   - Saved as `output.png`.

3. **Prediction Accuracy:**
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE) calculated to evaluate model.
   - Close tracking between predicted and actual values indicates successful modeling.

**Files Generated:**
- `output.png` : Visual comparison between actual and predicted stock prices.
- `model.h5` (if saved): Trained model for reuse.

**Next Steps:**
- Evaluate model on real-time data.
- Improve accuracy by fine-tuning hyperparameters and increasing training epochs.
